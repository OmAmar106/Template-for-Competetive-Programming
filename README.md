# Competitive Programming Python Snippets

This repository contains a collection of Python code snippets and templates designed to assist with competitive programming. These snippets cover a range of algorithms, data structures, and problem-solving techniques commonly used in competitive programming contests.

## Overview

The snippets provided in this repository are intended to serve as quick references or starting points for various programming problems. They are formatted to be included in the `python.json` file located in the AppData of Visual Studio Code for easy access and integration.

## Current Contents

The repository includes the following code snippets:

- **Segment Tree**: Efficient data structure for range queries and updates.
- **String Hashing**: Techniques for hashing strings to solve pattern matching problems.
- **Fenwick Tree (Binary Indexed Tree)**: Data structure for cumulative frequency tables and range queries.
- **Sieve of Eratosthenes**: Algorithm for finding all prime numbers up to a specified integer.
- **GCD (Greatest Common Divisor)**: Function for computing the greatest common divisor of two numbers.
- **LCM (Least Common Multiple)**: Function for computing the least common multiple of two numbers.
- **Hashing**: General hashing techniques for various use cases and few more stuff.

## In Progress

- Additional algorithms and data structures will be added over time to expand the utility of the repository. Contributions and suggestions for new snippets are welcome.
